# Getting started with PySpark

RFM is commonly used in marketing to evaluate a client’s value based on their:

* Recency: How recently has each customer made a purchase?
* Frequency: How often have they bought something?
* Monetary Value: How much money do they spend on average when making purchases?

# Dependencies

Use python3.11 because python3.12 doesn't ship with distutils as part of the standard library. This causes issues with pyspark 3.5.0.
